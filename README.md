# How to Play the Game
Teleporting is done with the left controller. The rendered line indicates where the teleport is aimed - the player can only teleport to large planets they are not currently on. There is a cooldown for teleporting. Activate the teleport with the left controller grip input.

Shooting is done with the right controller. Pick up the gun with the right controller grip input. Aim the gun at the bullets and use the right controller grip to grab a bullet, and press the right controller grip to shoot a grabbed bullet. Aim to hit the asteroids - a successful hit gains the player one point.

Feel free to look around, though the player cannot move. The score is displayed above the left controller.
