# How to Play the Game
Teleporting is done with the left controller. The rendered line indicates where the teleport is aimed - the player can only teleport to large planets they are not currently on. There is a cooldown for teleporting. Activate the teleport with the left controller trigger press input.

Grabbing is done with the right controller. You can pick up the gun (which should spawn in the character's vicinity) and the green falling objects (which can be picked up for points). Activate the grab with the right controller grip press input - a grabbed object will remain grabbed while the grip press input is held down.

Shooting is done with the right controller while the gun is being grabbed. Aim the gun and use the right controller trigger press input to fire bullets. Bullets can destroy certain obstacles, like the white falling planets and the asteroids. A successful hit gains the player one point.

Feel free to look around, though the player cannot move. The score is displayed above the left controller.
